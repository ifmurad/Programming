            design
            varies
            greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance
            travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a
            motorcycle
            and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending
            motorcycle
            rallies.
